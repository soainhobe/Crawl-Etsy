# README - ETSY PRODUCT INFORMATION CRAWLER TOOL

## Introduction
This project is a tool designed to crawl product information from the Etsy website. The tool is written in C# and runs in a console environment. I'm an amateur coder, so I'm not immune to silly logical errors in my code. If you spot any, please let me know so I can revise and improve my skills.

## Requirements
- .NET Framework (4.7.2)
- [HtmlAgilityPack](https://html-agility-pack.net/) library for HTML parsing
- [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) for JSON manipulation
- [RestSharp](https://restsharp.dev/) for making HTTP requests
- [ClosedXML](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML) for working with Excel files

## APIs Used
- **Etsy-API**: Used for accessing product information from the Etsy website.
- **Alura-API**: Utilized to retrieve detailed product information.
